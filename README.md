# 🌟 Silly_Physics
*A small corner of the internet where I explore physics the way I like it  curious, chaotic, and wonderfully fun.*

Welcome to my personal physics playground.  
I’m an MSc student in Quantum Technology. Exploring the surface of 
from random walks to quantum devices, from neuromorphic concepts to tiny 2D flakes  
that behave like they have personalities of their own.

This repo is my wall of experiments, notes, mistakes, surprises, and projects.

## 🧪 What You'll Find Here
Just a bunch of things I’ve built or studied out of curiosity:

### • Random Walks  
- **Random Walk of a Knight**  
  A fun experiment where a chess knight performs a random walk on a grid.cause why not...! 

### • Quantum & Device Physics  
- **Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG)**  
  My hardware project using Zener diodes and tunneling noise. well noises are not always a nuisance is it.
- **HOPG–MoS₂ Notes & Reports**  
  AFM, Raman, exfoliation, lithography — the whole messy adventure.Not fully updated though.

### • Scanning Probe & Nanotech  
- **AFM/STM Internship Report**  
  My experience on imaging tiny landscapes made of carbon and molybdenum.

## 🎯 Why This Repo Exists
Honestly?  
To keep my physics life organised *somewhere* 
but also open enough so people like me can stumble upon it.

I’m not trying to be formal here.  
This is my “learning-out-loud” space.

## 🪜 How to Use This Repo
Just browse the folders, open the PDFs, and enjoy the chaos.  
If something helps you — great.  
If something confuses you — even better. Curious minds grow like that.if you are reading this, we are pretty close...
